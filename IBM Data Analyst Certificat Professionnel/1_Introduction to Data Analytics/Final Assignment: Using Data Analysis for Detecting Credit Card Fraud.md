Refer to the data table below and identify 3 (three) errors/issues that could impact the accuracy of your findings. (3 marks)



 The date format is not standardized throughout the entire "transaction date" column  

There are missing values in "transaction value",  "age"," IP Address" 

Some values at "shipping address" are lacking informations. For exemple "In-store" value doesn't show the country or the city. 

Refer to the data table below and identify 2 (two) anomalies or unexpected behaviors, that would lead you to believe the transaction may be suspect. (2 marks)



For johnp, in a short period of time the number of units purchases jumped from 1 or 2 to 10, 15, 20

For johnp, the address shipping address changed 

For johnp the transcation value jumped from usually less than 150$ per order to 2000$ / 3000$ / 4000$

ellend has a purchase for a computer that costs 4,895$ and just for one unit. 

Briefly explain your key take-away from the provided data visualization chart. (1 mark)



The graph express the transaction value per transaction.

 It can visually highlight an anomaly. 

for davidg it seems that there is nothing to be worried about, all the transactions don't go up the 200$.

for johnp and ellend, the graphs clearly shows that the transactions clearly went from a maximum of 200$ to multiple thousands of dollars in multiple transactions for johnp wich is clearly a sign that there is something that we need to be worried about. 

For ellend it's only a one time transaction. It should ring a bell because the computer that has been bought with her account is really expensive. But it can also be a one time purchase for her birthday for exemple. 

Identify the type of analysis that you are performing when you are analyzing historical credit card data to understand what a fraudulent transaction looks like. 

Hint: The four types of Analytics include: Descriptive, Diagnostic, Predictive, Prescriptive. (1 mark)

It's a descriptive type of analysis.
