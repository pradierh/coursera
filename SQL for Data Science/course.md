## À propos de ce cours

As data collection has increased exponentially, the demand for individuals skilled in using and interacting with data has also grown. Data scientists play a crucial role in thinking critically, providing insights, making better decisions, and optimizing businesses. They are often described as "part mathematician, part computer scientist, and part trend spotter" (SAS Institute, Inc.). According to Glassdoor, being a data scientist is considered the best job in America, with a median base salary of $110,000 and numerous job openings.

To be a successful data scientist, one must be proficient in retrieving and working with data. This requires a solid understanding of SQL, the standard language for communicating with database systems. This course aims to provide you with the fundamentals of SQL and working with data, enabling you to analyze data for data science purposes. You will learn to ask the right questions, find good answers, and deliver valuable insights to your organization.

The course starts with the basics and assumes no prior knowledge of SQL. It gradually builds upon this foundation, guiding you to write simple and complex queries to select data from tables. You will work with different data types such as strings and numbers, and explore methods to filter and refine your results.

Throughout the course, you will create new tables, move data into them, and learn about common operators for data manipulation and combination. Topics like case statements, data governance, and profiling will be covered. Real-world programming assignments will provide practical experience, helping you interpret the structure, meaning, and relationships in source data. By using SQL professionally, you will shape your data for targeted analysis.

While there are no specific prerequisites or software requirements for this course, it is recommended to use a simple text editor for the final project. So, what are you waiting for? This is your first step toward landing a job in one of the most sought-after occupations in the US and beyond!

### CE QUE VOUS ALLEZ APPRENDRE (What You Will Learn)

## Programme de cours : ce que vous apprendrez dans ce cours

### SEMAINE 1
**Duration: 4 hours**

#### Getting Started and Selecting & Retrieving Data with SQL
In this module, you will learn the basics of SQL and its differences from other computer languages. You will compare the roles of a database administrator and a data scientist, and understand one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships with databases. Topics covered include using the SELECT statement, basic syntax rules, adding comments in your code, and the importance of code synthesis.

**Resources:** 11 videos (Total 52 min), 2 lectures, 4 quizzes

### SEMAINE 2
**Duration: 3 hours**

#### Filtering, Sorting, and Calculating Data with SQL
This module focuses on advanced SQL clauses and operators. You will learn to use clauses like WHERE, BETWEEN, IN, OR, NOT, LIKE, ORDER BY, and GROUP BY. The wildcard function for searching specific records will be covered, along with its advantages and disadvantages. Basic math operators and aggregate functions like AVERAGE, COUNT, MAX, MIN, and others will be discussed for data analysis.

**Resources:** 9 videos (Total 49 min), 1 lecture, 3 quizzes

---

### SEMAINE 3
**Duration: 3 hours**

#### Subqueries and Joins in SQL
This module dives into subqueries, their benefits, and when to use them. The concept of key fields and JOINs is explained to link data together. Different types of JOINs, including Cartesian join, inner join, left and right joins, full outer joins, and self join, are defined. Techniques like aliases and pre-qualifiers are covered to enhance SQL code cleanliness and efficiency.

**Resources:** 10 videos (Total 56 min), 2 lectures, 3 quizzes

### SEMAINE 4
**Duration: 4 hours**

#### Modifying and Analyzing Data with SQL
This module covers modifying strings by concatenation, trimming, changing case, and using the substring function. Date and time strings are specifically discussed. Case statements are introduced, and the module concludes with topics like data governance, profiling, and applying SQL in a data science context.
